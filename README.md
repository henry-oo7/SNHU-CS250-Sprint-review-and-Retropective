# SNHU-CS250-Sprint-review-and-Retropective
This repository contains a retrospective analysis of the SNHU Travel application, detailing the use of the Scrum-Agile framework to manage a dynamic project with evolving client needs.

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
I learned that interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is an iterative and continuous process, not a one-time event. The Product Owner is key to this by acting as the voice of the customer. They work to understand the client's vision and then translate those needs into a product backlog.

Creating user stories is a critical part of this process. They break down large, vague requirements into smaller, manageable, and testable pieces. A user story focuses on the "who, what, and why" from the user's perspective (e.g., "As a user, I want to set a price limit when searching so that I can find a trip within my budget"). This format ensures the development team is always building with the end user in mind, making it easier to deliver features that are actually valuable.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
I've learned to approach program development with a flexible and adaptive mindset, prioritizing continuous feedback over rigid, upfront planning. The Agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future work are:

Daily Stand-ups: These short, daily meetings are essential for keeping the team aligned, transparent, and quick to identify any roadblocks.

Sprint Reviews: Conducting regular reviews of completed work with the client or stakeholders ensures the project is always on the right track and provides crucial feedback early in the process.

Kanban Boards: Using a visual tool like a Kanban board to track progress and workflow provides a clear, transparent view of what the team is doing and where potential bottlenecks are.

Retrospective Meetings: Looking back at what went well and what could be improved after each sprint is vital for continuous process improvement.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Being a good team member in software development means being collaborative, communicative, and adaptable. It's not about working in isolation. The most important qualities include:

Self-Organization: A good team member doesn't wait to be told what to do. They take ownership of their work and actively seek out the next most valuable task.

Effective Communication: Being able to clearly communicate progress, roadblocks, and ideas in a concise way is crucial. The example of the daily stand-up ("Yesterday, I finished... today I will work on... no blockers") is a perfect demonstration of this.

Adaptability: Being open to change and new ideas, especially when the client's needs evolve, is a core part of an Agile team. It's about being a problem-solver who can handle interruptions without derailing the team's progress.
